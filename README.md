## Introduction 

This is a game for [js13kGames](https://js13kgames.com/). It's my first time submitting a game, and also my first time seriously messing around with HTML Canvas! You can play the game [here](https://js13kgames.com/entries/parry).

### What's js13kGames?
js13kGames is a yearly "game jam" event, in which participants are challenged to create a game within the limits of 13kb. Each year, there is a different theme to make your game about. This year, the theme was "The 13th Century."

### What's the 13th Century?
The 13th Century was a chunk of time during which, according to Wikipedia, pretty much only war happened. In this game, you play a pacifist who's just trying to survive. While a bunch of enemies attack you, your goal is to simply parry their attacks.

## Game Instructions 
+ Move your sword with the mouse.
+ Rotate with Q or E.
+ Parry enemy attacks by intersecting the enemy sword for half a second.
+ Try to create perpendicular angles between both swords (i.e. make a 'cross' or 'x' shape). This will give you a higher score.
+ If you don't parry the enemy sword in time, it will attack you, lowering your score.

## Enemy Descriptions
1. Peasant: Slow, but unpredictable.
2. Barbarian: Quick, but predictable.
3. Paladin: Like the barbarian, but smarter.

4. Archer: Long-ranged sniper.
5. Duelist: Skilled and precise.
6. Dual Wielder: High-speed assassin. 

## Tools Used
+ For sound effects, I used the awesome [ZzFX](https://killedbyapixel.github.io/ZzFX/) ([github](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/ZzFX)).
+ For collision detection, I am very thankful to Qixotl LFC for making [this tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvlhMEE9zuc). I also found [Pikuma's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EsWKT7Doww&t=1686s) very informative.

## Final Notes
I'm now aware that monitors can have different refresh rates... I made this on a 60hz monitor. Currently, for users with 120hz screens, this game will be 2x more difficult :)
Hoping to patch this eventually.
